Absolutely!

Remeber that the "heartworm preventatives" we recommend (such as Interceptor) also prevents hookworms, roundworms, and whipworms which occur more frequently than heartworms. Even though the mosquitoes that transmit heartworms to our pets are nor present in the winter, they still face exposure to the other parasites.

Combination products that also protect against external parasites such as fleas and ticks are now available (such as the Advantage Multi).

### Why will you not you declaw my cat if I am uninterested in having it spayed or neutered?
Cats that have not been spayed or neutered are generally more aggressive and territorial. That means they are more likely to encroach on the territory of other cats. Without claws they are defenseless. We further recommend that cats without claws spend their lives indoors.
